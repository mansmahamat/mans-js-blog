I'm Mansour, a frontend developer for 2 years now, I left France 🇫🇷 to live in Sweden 🇸🇪 with my wife and our 2 children.

I enjoy frontend development because it allows me to build cool interfaces and play with API's.

I have always wanted to work in IT since childhood but I never took that direction at school.

In 2018, I decided to learn coding on my own for 6 months with sites such as OpenClassrooms & Freecodecamp after a career as a textile salesman and handler.
